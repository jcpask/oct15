        <h3>The Update</h3>
        <p>
            My api can be found <a href="https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/resource/pi4w-3vc9.json">here</a>.  It's EU data that 
            basically shows a member country and lists the funds allocated to it from the European Union 
            (more context is 
            <a href="https://cohesiondata.ec.europa.eu/2014-2020/2014-2020-Financial-Allocations-by-Member-State-Br/pi4w-3vc9">here</a>).

            Here's my mock-up:

            There's a lot I don't know.  First, I'm not sure how to make a table, how to add columns and take them away with the click of a button (which i
            the core of what I want the page to do).  I'm also still unclear about how the ".then" functions testing for errors work, but I
            will figure that out.  Here are a few things I do know.  My promise seems to be good and I have the data there.  My banner
            is working, and I have some buttons up.  I tried to mirror Dr. Bradshaw's most recent planet app, but it has a lot of elements I don't need.
